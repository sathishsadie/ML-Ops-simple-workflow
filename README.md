# Titanic Survival Prediction
### This project is a machine learning pipeline designed to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using the Titanic dataset. The pipeline consists of data ingestion, transformation, model training, and model saving, utilizing several classification models to identify the best-performing one


## Project Overview
### The project aims to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. It involves:

### 1. Data Ingestion: Loading the Titanic dataset from a CSV file.
### 2.Data Transformation: Handling categorical variables by encoding them into numerical form using LabelEncoder.
### 3.Model Training: Using different classifiers like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree to train on the transformed data and selecting the model with the highest accuracy.
### 4.Model Saving: Saving both the trained model and the label encoders for future use.
